        Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists: In early U.S. history, these factions debated the nature of the Constitution. Federalists, led by figures like Alexander Hamilton, supported a strong central government, while Anti-Federalists, like Patrick Henry, advocated for greater state autonomy and insisted on a Bill of Rights before ratifying the Constitution.
Jacobins and Girondins: During the French Revolution, these factions had conflicting views on governance. The radical Jacobins favored sweeping changes, while the moderate Girondins sought a more restrained approach.
Modern factions often form in politics, organizations, and entertainment, representing various ideologies and goals.
